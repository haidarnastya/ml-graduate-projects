# ml-graduate-projects

Graduate-level machine learning coursework at USC, focused on implementing and
evaluating models in Python.

This repository contains selected coursework from my graduate Machine Learning
course (DSCI 552), covering supervised and unsupervised learning, optimization,
and model evaluation.

## Key Topics
- Linear, multiple, and logistic regression
- Time series analysis
- Binary and multiclass classification
- Regularization and bias–variance tradeoffs
- Decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting (XGBoost)
- Support vector machines (SVMs)
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Model evaluation and error analysis
